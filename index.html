Hello World
</body>
<p>
  My cause has always been to have fun, do what I love, and help others along the way.  From a young age I was always taught to help others and I have always tried to do so.  I have also always tried to have fun in life.  One of my favorite hobbies is playing video games and I have always wanted to make them so trying to get a job in that industry has also always been a cause of mine which is why I have always been interested in computer science.  I hope all my work up to this point and beyond will help land me a job in the industry I love.
